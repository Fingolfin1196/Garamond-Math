# Garamond-Math

- An OTF math font matching the [EB Garamond](https://github.com/octaviopardo/EBGaramond12/).

- Glyphs from the [TeX Gyre Termes Math](http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tg-math/) and [XITS Math](https://github.com/khaledhosny/xits) fonts are used to fill those unavailable in EB Garamond, but most of them are modified for a more unified style.

- TeX files are from [FiraMath](https://github.com/Stone-Zeng/FiraMath) repository.
